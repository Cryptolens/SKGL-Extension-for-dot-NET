# Release notes for v408

## Price prediction using AI
We have added several methods that allow you to collect usage information of various features in your software. 
You can read the entire docs about it [here](http://app.cryptolens.io/docs/api/v3/RegisterEvent).

The idea behind the logging methods is to allow you to determine the optimal price for the different features in your application. We do
this by first collecting information about how features are used and then combine this information with actual purchases (i.e. when a customer buys the entire product). The goal is to allow you to understand which features are most valuable to your customers.

In the .NET package, you can call `AI.RegisterEvent` to either register an event in the client app or a successful transaction (in this case, you can provide `value` and `currency`).
