# Release notes for v4023

## Virtual machine check

We have added a new helper method, `Helpers.IsVM()`, which helps to detect if the code is running in a virtual environment. The code was tested in Microsoft Hyper-V, but we expect it to work in VMware and other virtualization environments. In order to detect if it is a VM, we check the Manufacturer and Product fields.

> Note: users may still be able to change these fields if they really want to.
