# Release notes for v4030

## Update the model in Activate and Get Key

The `LicenseKey` model that is returned in `Key.Activate` and `Key.GetKey` has received a few updates. First, we have added a `Reseller` object (similar to the `Customer` object).
Secondly, we have added `FloatingExpires` to `ActivationData`, which is will be specified when floating licensing is used. An important difference from the previous version, the list of `ActivatedMachines` will contain a list of all activated devices (both node-locked and floating).
