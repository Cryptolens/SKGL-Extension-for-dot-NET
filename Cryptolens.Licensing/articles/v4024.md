# Release notes for v4024

## Same machine code across different languages

Since the introduction of [Helpers.GetMachineCodePI](https://help.cryptolens.io/api/dotnet/api/SKM.V3.Methods.Helpers.html#SKM_V3_Methods_Helpers_GetMachineCodePI), we have been working on
unifying the machine code generation across different languages.

In this update, we have introduced a new version of the machine code method, which can be called by `Helpers.GetMachineCodePI(v:2)`. The output from this method will be the same in Python (if v=2 is specified there too) on Windows, assuming it is computed on the same device.

Our goal is to support Mac and Linux too in a future release. Once this is accomplished, a new method will be published. For now, we will use a versioning parameter until support for all platforms is available.

> [!NOTE]
> Note: this change is only applicable to .NET and Python clients on Windows.
