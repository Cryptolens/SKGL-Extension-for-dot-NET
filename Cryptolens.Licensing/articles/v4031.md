# Release notes for v4031

## Add methods create and remove messages

We have added new methods in the Messaging API that allow you to create or remove messages. In most cases, these methods (i.e. create and remove message) should
not be called within the client applications. Only `Message.GetMessages` is thought to be called from the client application.
