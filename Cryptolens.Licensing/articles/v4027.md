# Release notes for v4027

## User based activations
Normally, node-locking (aka machine code locking) occurs on a per device basis. If your users change devices often, you can either use floating licensing or activate on a per user basis. "Adding a user" to a license can be accomplished with `Key.Activate` and to verify a user using `Key.GetKey` in combination with `Helpers.VerifyPassword`. In practice, each user is an activation, where the password is stored as a **machine code** in secure form and **friendly name** is used for the username. 

> [!NOTE]
> This is method is different from [user account authentication](https://help.cryptolens.io/licensing-models/user-login-intro), where a new Cryptolens account is created for each user. Using user based activations does not create a new user, it only stores the user information locally in the license. The user has no way to change the password on their own by default.


```cs
var username = "testuser";
var password = Helpers.ComputePasswordHash("testpassword");

// Adding a user
var res = Key.Activate(AccessToken.AccessToken.Activate, new ActivateModel 
{ 
    Key = "KMZEW-SBRAE-VWCEK-CDLQE", 
    ProductId = 3349,
    MachineCode = password,
    FriendlyName = username
});
Assert.IsTrue(Helpers.IsSuccessful(res));


//verifying password
var res2 = Key.GetKey(AccessToken.AccessToken.GetKey, new KeyInfoModel
{
    Key = "KMZEW-SBRAE-VWCEK-CDLQE",
    ProductId = 3349
});

Assert.IsTrue(Helpers.VerifyPassword(res2.LicenseKey, "testuser", "testpassword"));
Assert.IsFalse(Helpers.VerifyPassword(res2.LicenseKey, "testuser", "testpassword2"));
```

## Ambiguous method IsOnRightMachinePI
A previous updated caused Helpers.IsOnRightMachinePI to require all optional parameters ([issue 56](https://github.com/Cryptolens/cryptolens-dotnet/issues/56)). This is now fixed so that
the method can be called with only the LicenseKey object being provided.
