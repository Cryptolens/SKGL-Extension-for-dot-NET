# Release notes for v4028

## Updated Helpers.GetMachineCode for Linux and Raspberry Pi
In this release we have updated the Helpers.GetMachineCode and Helpers.GetMachineCodePI() methods so that they work on Linux. We will discuss this in more details below:

### General
Based on our tests, previous versions of the library **always** falled back on the Mac version of the UUID script in cases where we could not determine if the OS is Mac or Linux. This is now fixed.

### Linux

If we cannot determine the type of hardware where the application is running, we will use the UUID of the boot device as follows:

```
findmnt --output=UUID --noheadings --target=/boot
```

### Raspberry Pi
If we can determine that the application is running on a Raspberry Pi (by calling `cat /proc/device-tree/model`), we will use the serial number of the device, which is obtained using the following command:

```
cat /proc/cpuinfo
```
