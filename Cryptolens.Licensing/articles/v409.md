# Release notes for v408

## Message API
We have added `GetMessages` method that allows your application to listen to messages, which you can broadcast on https://app.cryptolens.io/Message).

## Fix dates in signature verification

We have changed the reference time used when verifying signatures (where current time matters) to use the Utc time instead of the local time.
