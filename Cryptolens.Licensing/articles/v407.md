# Release notes for v407

## Fix potential issues with Newtonsoft.Json versions
When we added support for .NET Standard, we specified the same version of Newtonsoft.Json (i.e. v.11.0.2) to be used for all the frameworks, i.e. for .NET Framework 4.0 and 4.6, and .NET Standard.

Some users who use Visual Studio 2012 experienced issues to install this version of Newtonsoft.Json, as it is a .NET Standard pacakge. As a solution, we have set all .NET Framework builds to target Newtonsoft.Json 6.0.8 and the .NET Standard to target 11.0.2.

## Enable Customer Association parameter
[Add Customer](https://help.cryptolens.io/api/dotnet/api/SKM.V3.Methods.CustomerMethods.html#SKM_V3_Methods_CustomerMethods_AddCustomer_System_String_SKM_V3_Models_AddCustomerModel_) method now supports retrieval of the customer portal link, which can be sent to customers so that they can manage their licenses.

In order to access this link, you need to set `EnableCustomerAssociation` to true.
