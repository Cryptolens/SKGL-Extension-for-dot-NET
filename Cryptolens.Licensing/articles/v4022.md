# Release notes for v4022

## Support for Friendly Name
We have added support for a new parameter and field, `FriendlyName`, which allows you to associate a friendly device name
together with each activation (end user/machinecode/seat/device fingerprint). This is especially good if you have customers that have
thousands of end users/machine codes on the same license key. When, for example, an employee leaves the company, it is easy to
find the machine code using the friendly name.

This change affects Activate and GetKey methods. There is both an option to specify the friendly name as a parameter and to retreive it
in the ActivationData (inside the license key object).

## Get WebAPILog support
It is now possible to retrieve the Web API Log (https://app.cryptolens.io/docs/api/v3/GetWebAPILog) through the .NET Client. This method
can be used both on the server side and inside the client application. However, if you do use it inside the client app, please set
`KeyLock=-1` of the access token. Otherwise, the customer might be able to get the log for other users.
