# Release notes for v4019

## Updates to Activate and Deactivate

In the previous release, we introduced the option to collect OS related data using `RegisterEvent`. However, this would require two request, which would increase the latency. Moreover, `RegisterEvent` required a special access token.

To simplify collection of this data, it's now built into the `Activate` and `Deactivate` methods. If you want to pass into different metadata, you can set `OSInfo`
to something else. If you don't need this additional metadata, you can always turn it off by setting `OSInfo=""`.
