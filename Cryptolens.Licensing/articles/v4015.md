# Release notes for v4015

## Platform independent machine code method
We improved the machine code generation function to make it platform independent. It can now be run on Windows, Mac and Linux as well as in Unity.
If you plan to target multiple platforms, we recommend to get this package directly from https://github.com/Cryptolens/cryptolens-dotnet/releases and select those in the "Without System.Management" folder.

If you use the binaries without System.Management, no further actions are necessary to use the new machine code method. If use the NuGet package, you need to use Helpers.GetMachineCodePI() or Helpers.IsOnRightMachinePI().

## Support for .NET 3.5, 4.7 and 4.7.1
The library now supports several new versions of the .NET Framework and also .NET 3.5 (for older project).
