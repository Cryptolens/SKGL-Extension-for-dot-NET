# Release notes for v4034

This release comes with the following updates:

* Add `Edit Customer` method.
* Add support for [feature templates](https://help.cryptolens.io/web-interface/feature-templates). This allows you define more complex feature hierarchies and use more than 8 features.
* Add missing `Name` parameter in some data object related methods.
* Fix the overload of `IsOnRightMachine` that accepts custom machine code so that it is compatible with floating licenses when ModelVersion=3 is used.
